# Gamer-rage-Predictor-AIML-Project

# 🎮 Gamer Rage Level Predictor

## 😂 Overview
This project predicts how angry a gamer might get based on the number of hours they’ve played and the number of losses using **Linear Regression**.

## 📊 Dataset
A mock dataset with 3 features:
- `hours_played`: Continuous gaming hours
- `losses`: Number of matches lost
- `rage_level`: Rage score (1–100)

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🧠 ML Model
- Linear Regression model trained to fit rage level based on gaming patterns.

## 🔥 Output
- Console output of Mean Squared Error
- Scatter plot showing actual vs predicted rage levels

## 🎯 Goal
To show that ML can be applied even to fun and silly topics like gamer rage. This project also serves as a demonstration of linear regression for educational purposes.
